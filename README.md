# Own_Python_IDE
Python IDE using Tkinter

I created a very basic Integrated Developement Environment(IDE) for Python using Tkinter and Subprocess module.
Using this basic IDE we can run all sorts of Basic Python Programs as well as Arrays, Strings...etc

And it  gives the required error as well if any error occurs.
